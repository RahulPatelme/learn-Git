A git repository is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder locally.

1. git status command gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents.

2. git init command is used to create a new git repository. Before we do anything git related,
we must initialise a repository first.

Do not init a repo inside of a repo.
Before running git init, use git status to verify that you are not currently inside of a repository.

3. Use git add command to stage changes to be committed.

Working Directory -> git add -> Staging Area ->
git commit -> repository

4. Use the git commit command to commit changes from the staging area.
git commit -m "message"

5. git log command shows logs of commits.

6. git add . command to stage all changes at once.
