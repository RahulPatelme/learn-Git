A git repository is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder locally.

1. git status command gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents.

2. git init command is used to create a new git repository. Before we do anything git related,
we must initialise a repository first.

- Do not init a repo inside of a repo.
- Before running git init, use git status to verify that you are not currently inside of a repository.

3. Use git add command to stage changes to be committed.
