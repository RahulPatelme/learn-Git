Git is a version control system (VCS).
Version control is a software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.

Fork can be seen as an alternative route.

Git vs Github
1. Git is a VCS that runs locally on our computer. We can use git without never touching Github.
2. Github is a web service that hosts git repositories in the cloud.
3. Git is primarily a terminal tool.
